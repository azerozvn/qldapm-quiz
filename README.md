# qldapm-quiz
Official bucket for QLDAPM 2015 assignment  

This project will be splited into two distinctive branch known as 'front-end' and 'back-end', each corresponded to its own name  

## Setup

To setup, first clone this repo (SSH would be prefer)

```
git clone https://github.com/azerozvn/qldapm-quiz.git
```

After that checkout to two branch consecutively

```
git checkout front-end
```

```
git checkout back-end
```

Front-end branch keeps all front-end source code such as template and stylings for the page, while back-end branch control the functionalities as planned

## Code Control

To push your code, remember to take it to the assigned branch, this mean you won't be allowed to push to **master** branch without permission  

If you are doing back-end, checkout to your local 'back-end' branch, commit and push it to origin/backend  

```
git push origin back-end
```

The same for front-end branch, if you want to pull the template code to view, stay in your 'front-end' branch

```
git pull origin front-end
```

Please keep in mind that you have to push your code to respective branch, **NOT MASTER**
